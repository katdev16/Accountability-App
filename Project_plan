o implement this terminal-based accountability tracking application, you'll need to design a robust system that integrates various functionalities including task management, point tracking, Google Calendar integration, email reporting, and persistent data storage. Here is a detailed plan and suggested tech stack to achieve this:

1. Project Planning
Functional Requirements
Task Management: Users can add tasks, set deadlines, and mark tasks as complete.
Point System: Points are awarded based on task completion.
Accountability Assessment: Users are marked as accountable or not based on points.
Reason for Incompletion: Users must provide reasons for incomplete tasks.
Weekly Report: A report of completed and incomplete tasks sent via email.
Google Calendar Integration: Tasks are added to the user's Google Calendar.
Persistent Data Storage: Data remains intact across script runs.
Non-functional Requirements
User Authentication: Secure login system for users.
Data Security: Secure storage of user data and tasks.
Reliability: Ensure data is not lost and system is robust.


2. Tech Stack
Backend
Python: Main programming language for the application.
SQLite: Lightweight database for storing tasks and user data.
Google Calendar API: For adding tasks to the user's Google Calendar.
SMTP Library: For sending email reports.
Libraries and Tools
Click: For building the command-line interface (CLI).
SQLAlchemy: For ORM and database management.
OAuth2Client: For handling Google API authentication.
smtplib: For sending emails via SMTP.
datetime: For handling dates and times.


3. Implementation Plan
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
Create a virtual environment.
Install necessary packages:
sh
Copy code
pip install click sqlalchemy google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

Step 2: Database Design
Users Table: Store user details and credentials.
Tasks Table: Store task details, deadlines, completion status, and points.
Reports Table: Store weekly reports for each user.


Step 3: User Authentication
Implement a simple authentication system to manage users.


Step 4: Task Management
Add Task: CLI command to add tasks with deadlines.
Mark Task Complete: CLI command to mark tasks as complete and award points.
Provide Reason for Incompletion: CLI command to provide reasons for incomplete tasks.


Step 5: Google Calendar Integration
Set up OAuth2 for Google Calendar API.
Create functions to add tasks to the user's Google Calendar.


Step 6: Weekly Report Generation
Create a function to generate a weekly report.
Send the report via email using SMTP.


Step 7: Persistent Data Storage
Use SQLite and SQLAlchemy to ensure data is persisted between script runs.
