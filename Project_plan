1. Project Structure and Design
Classes and Components:
com.katdev.accountabilityapp.model.Task Class: Represents each task with attributes such as description, due date, completion status, points, and reason for non-completion.
User Class: Represents the user with attributes like name, email, and accumulated points.
TaskManager Class: Handles CRUD operations for tasks, points calculation, and generating reports.
EmailService Class: Sends weekly reports via email.
GoogleCalendarService Class: Integrates with Google Calendar to add tasks.
Persistence:
Database: Use JDBC or an ORM framework like Hibernate to store tasks and user data persistently. SQLite can be a lightweight option for embedded databases.
External APIs:
Google Calendar API: Interact with Google Calendar to add tasks automatically.
JavaMail API: Send email reports at the end of each week.


2. Tech Stack
Java: Core programming language for application logic.
SQLite: Embedded database for storing task and user data.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Interface for connecting Java applications with databases.
Google Calendar API for Java: Library for integrating tasks with Google Calendar.
JavaMail API: Library for sending emails programmatically.



3. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and set up your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
Step 2: Design Your Classes and Database Schema
Define classes (com.katdev.accountabilityapp.model.Task, User) and their attributes.
Design database schema for tasks and users using SQLite or any preferred database.
Step 3: Implement com.katdev.accountabilityapp.model.Task and User Management
Implement CRUD operations for tasks and users using JDBC or Hibernate.
Calculate points based on task completion status.
Step 4: Integrate Google Calendar API
Set up authentication with Google API and implement methods to add tasks to Google Calendar.
Step 5: Implement Email Reporting
Use JavaMail API to send weekly reports via email with a summary of completed and non-completed tasks.
Step 6: Implement Data Persistence
Ensure data persistence using SQLite or chosen database technology.
Test data integrity and persistence across application runs.
Step 7: Testing and Validation
Write unit tests using JUnit to validate functionality of individual components.
Perform integration testing to ensure components work together seamlessly.
Step 8: Deployment and Distribution
Package your application as a standalone executable JAR file.
Optionally, deploy on cloud platforms or distribute to users as needed.



4. Considerations
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
Security: Securely handle user data and API credentials.
Usability: Ensure a user-friendly interface even in a terminal-based application.
Scalability: Consider future scalability requirements if expanding beyond a single user or adding more features.



5. Timeline
Learning and Preparation: 2-3 weeks to familiarize yourself with Java, JDBC/Hibernate, Google Calendar API, and JavaMail API.
Implementation: 4-6 weeks depending on complexity and learning curve.
Testing and Refinement: Allocate time for testing, bug fixing, and refining features.
Conclusion
By following this plan, you can effectively implement a terminal-based accountability tracking application in Java. Focus on modular design, data integrity, and integration with external services like Google Calendar and email for a comprehensive solution. Continuous testing and refinement will ensure a robust and reliable application that meets your accountability tracking needs.
